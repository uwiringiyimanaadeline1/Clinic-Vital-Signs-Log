Clinic Vital Signs Log (Python Demo)

This project demonstrates the use of Python core data types (integers, strings, booleans, lists, arrays, and dictionaries) in a simple clinic vital signs logging system.

📌 Features

Integers

Store and process patients’ blood pressure readings.

Compute total, average, minimum, and maximum values.

Strings

Generate a formatted report of the vital signs log.

Booleans

Check if the average blood pressure exceeds a set threshold using compound conditions.

Lists

Manage vital sign entries as strings (BP-120, BP-135, …).

Add new values, filter based on conditions, and sort results.

Arrays

Use Python’s array module to demonstrate fixed-size numeric storage.

Compare sums between arrays and lists.

Dictionaries

Store and manage patient records (id, name, value).

Update a record, delete another, and compute totals from dictionary fields.

🖥️ Example Output
Clinic Vital Signs Log Report
Total Blood Pressure Readings: 638
Average Blood Pressure: 127.60
Minimum BP: 115, Maximum BP: 140
Status: Below Standard

Original List: ['BP-120', 'BP-135', 'BP-128', 'BP-140', 'BP-115']
Modified & Sorted List: ['BP-120', 'BP-128', 'BP-130', 'BP-135', 'BP-140']

Array Sum: 638
List Sum: 638

Updated Records:
{'id': 1, 'name': 'Patient A', 'value': 120}
{'id': 2, 'name': 'Patient B', 'value': 138}

Total of 'value' field across records: 258

🚀 How to Run
